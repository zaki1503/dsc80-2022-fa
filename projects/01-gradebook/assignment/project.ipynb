    "### Putting Everything Together\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few remarks and tips for approaching Project 1, and projects more generally:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you are having trouble figuring out what a question is asking you to do, look at the big picture and try to understand what the current step is doing to contribute to this big picture. This may clarify what's being asked!\n",
    "1. These questions intentionally build off of each other and the final result matters! In fact, you can \"get a question correct\", but only receive partial credit for it because a previous answer was wrong.\n",
    "    - Credit for a question will typically receive partial credit based on *how close* your answer is to correct (as well as some credit for a solution in the correct form). \n",
    "    - You should try to assess your answer to each question based on what you understand of the data. This might involve writing extensive code (that isn't turned in) just to check your work! Suggestions on checking your work are given in the assignment, but you should also think of your own ways of checking your work.\n",
    "    - As you do this project, think about the data from the perspective of the student (which should be easy to do, since you've used Gradescope before!)\n",
    "1. To test the correctness of your answers:\n",
    "     - Once you have implemented a particular function in `project.py`, you should test out your function in the notebook. In particular, you should inspect/analyze the output to assess its correctness.\n",
    "    - Run your functions on the main dataset (`grades`) and ask yourself if the output *looks correct.*\n",
    "    - Run your functions on very small datasets (e.g. 1-5 row DataFrames that you construct by hand), calculate the expected output by hand, and see if the function output matches (this *is* unit-testing your code with data).\n",
    "    * Run your functions on (large and small) samples of the dataset `grades`. Does your code break, or does it still run as expected?"
