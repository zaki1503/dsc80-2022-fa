    "# Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "This project aims to explore how selected features from the outages dataset can be used to predict the duration of a power outage by training a Random Forest Regression Model. Both RMSE and R-squared will be used to analyze the accuracy and predictive characteristics of the model. First a Baseline model was constructed to serve as a lower bound of what can be expected and was then modified to include transformed features and different parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Model\n",
    "The Baseline Model was constructed to use 9 features from the outages dataset to form the probablistic trees of the Random Forest. The Month, State, NERC Region, Climate Region, Year, and Cause Category features, being categorical, were one-hot encoded. The Climate Category feature was ordinally encoded (due to Climate Category being ordinal as hot > normal > cold). For the baseline model, the max depth parameter of 5 for the Random Forest Regressor was arbritrarily selected. The baseline model resulted in a model which was overfitted to it training data because its training R2 of ~0.669 was much higher than its test R2 of 0.138. Additionally, the baseline model testing RMSE was 233% higher than its training RMSE- ~6927.913 and 2966.882, respectively. The baseline model has poor predictive performance outside of its training set as well even having relatively poor predictive performance within it. The baseline model has huge room for improvement as it is neither good at interpolation on its training data nor at extrapolating to test data it has not been trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Model\n",
    "To improve the baseline model, all numerical features ('PC.REALGSP.STATE', 'POPULATION') were standardized to eliminate scaling issues and a new feature was introduced in the form of the hour of the outage start as a transformation of the outage start feature from the original dataset. Outage start hour provides the Random Forest much more resolution on discriminating between outages which occured in the same month year and even day for example. Additionally, the hour feature makes intuitive sense as an outage that started at 3 AM is most likely going to take longer to fix compared to one at 3 PM for example. Next, the best Random Forest hyperparameters were found using a 5-fold grid search cross validation to be max depth of 11, use all features, and 128 trees. In hindsight, the Random Forest model is not well suited to this task as the final model also performed worse on the training dataset in both RMSE and R2. However, the final model was better at its regression task compared to the baseline. The most stark difference is the difference in R2 across the final and baseline model. In the training set, the final model 20% better at 0.818. While the final model's test R2 is still low at around 0.23, it is around 70% better at representing the variance in outage duration correctly. The improvements in RMSE are not as dramatic meaning the final model is still overfitting to the noise in the training set. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Fairness Evaluation\n",
    "I decided to determine if my final model explained the variation in outage duration better for outages affecting higher populations compared to outages in lower population. This is due to the fact there are many more outages present above a population value of 1,000,000 compared to below 1,000,000 and this could be providing the model more clarity and resolution for these more populous areas. To test this I used the difference in R2 between the two subsets (1M> and 1M<) with the null hypothesis positing no significance difference between the R2 of the two sets and the alternative being the R2 for higher populated outages being higher than lower populated areas. The permutation test resulted in a p-value of 0.527, meaning the observed difference in R2 was not statistically significant to reject the null hypothesis. The model does not explain the variance in outage durations better for more populated areas compared to lower populated areas."
