    "## About the Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Language Models (LM)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will build *[statistical language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model)* using public domain books found on [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). Language models attempt to capture the likelihood that a given sequence of words occur in a given \"language\" (the precise term is \"corpus\" or \"corpora\"). Here, \"language\" is a broad term that, in addition to the normal usage, may mean the language of a particular author or style. As with all statistical models, the true data generating process is never known and thus we cannot know the true probability that a sequence of words will occur – however, we can estimate these probabilities via various methods, some of which are more reliable than others. For example, one might guess that the probability of a sentence is simply the product of the empirical probabilities (i.e., the number of times a word is observed in a dataset divided by the number of words in that dataset). This is one of the methods of estimating the probability of a sequence of words that you will implement in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tokenizing Corpora\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing the probabilities of a language model from a book requires breaking up the text of book into sequences of words. This process is called *tokenization*. In reality though, the sequences are not made up entirely of words, but rather more general terms called *tokens*. In this project tokens will include not only whole words, but also punctuation and other terms. Below are a few examples of other types of tokens:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Punctuation. For example, the period makes sense as a token, as certain words tend to end sentences (i.e. appear right before a `'.'`), while other words tend to begin sentences (i.e. appear right after a `'.'`).\n",
    "* We have special \"START\" and \"END\" tokens that begin and end every word sequence (in our case, paragraphs of words in a given book). These make sense as tokens, as certain words may tend to begin and end paragraphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful for the tokens used to represent START and END to be single characters that can never be found in the text of the book you use to create your language model. Thus, you will use two ASCII hidden \"[control characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes#C0_(ASCII_and_derivatives))\":\n",
    "* For START, you will use the character `'\\x02'`, which refers to the \"beginning of text\".\n",
    "* For END, you will use the character `'\\x03'`, which refers to the \"end of text\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Note on Checking Your Work for Correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a language model, you will need to perform several steps, from data cleaning to implementing mathematical formulas. **Things will get messy, and it can be difficult to assess the correctness of your work.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The doctests will include checks on the inputs and outputs of your methods.\n",
    "- The `grade.check` public notebook tests will be **more informative** than the doctests, but they still won't guarantee that your code is correct.\n",
    "- The doctests include small-enough examples that you should be able to determine the correct outputs (e.g. probabilities) by hand.\n",
    "- Run your functions on **real books** taken from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) and make sure that their behavior looks correct. After selecting a book, click the \"Plain Text UTF-8\" link to find the book's text ([example](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/68085/pg68085.txt))."

The `train` method will then use that data to create a model which is saved in the `mdl` attribute. This code is given to you.\n",
    "* The `train` method takes in a list of tokens (e.g. the output of `tokenize`) and outputs a language model. **This language model is represented as a `Series`, whose index consists of tokens and whose values are the probabilities that the tokens occur.** (In the case of the N-Gram model in Part 3/Question 5, the model will be represented as a DataFrame instead of a Series – more on this later.)\n",
    "* The `probability` method takes in a sequence of tokens and returns the probability that this sequence occurs under the language model.\n",
    "* The `sample` method takes in a positive integer `M` and generates a string made up of `M` tokens using the language model. **This method generates random sentences!**\n",

    "### Question 3 – Uniform Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name='question3'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "A uniform language model is one in which each **unique** word is equally likely to appear in any position, unconditional of any other information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's put into context what this means by using the following example corpus:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    ">>> corpus = 'when I eat pizza, I smile, but when I drink Coke, my stomach hurts'\n",
    ">>> tokenize(corpus)\n",
    "['\\x02', 'when', 'I', 'eat', 'pizza', ',', 'I', 'smile', ',', 'but', 'when', 'I', 'drink', 'Coke', ',', 'my', 'stomach', 'hurts', '\\x03']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a tokenized corpus, you need to build the language model itself in `train`. As mentioned above, language models are stored as Series, where words are the index and probabilities are the values. **In a uniform language model**, the probability assigned to each token is **1 over the total number of unique tokens in the corpus**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example corpus above has 14 **unique** tokens. This means that we'd have $P(\\text{\\x02}) = \\frac{1}{14}$, $P(\\text{when}) = \\frac{1}{14}$, and so on. Specifically, in this example, **the Series that `train` returns should contain the following values**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Token | Probability |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| `'\\x02'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'when'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'I'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'eat'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'pizza'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `','` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'smile'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'but'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'drink'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'Coke'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'my'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'stomach'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'hurts'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "| `'\\x03'` | $\\frac{1}{14}$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that:\n",
    "- **None of the probabilities we computed are conditional – the uniform model does not use conditional probabilities!**\n",
    "- When looking at the Series that `train` returns (i.e. when looking at the `mdl` attribute), the `'\\x02'` and `'\\x03'` characters will show up as blank characters in the index. This is to be expected.\n",
    "- Your Series doesn't need to have the labels `'Token'` or `'Probability'` in it, like the above table does.\n",
    "\n",
    "After training the model, you need to implement two more methods, `probability` and `sample`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`probability` should take in any tuple of tokens and use the probabilities you computed in `train` (that are stored in the `mdl` attribute) to assign a probability to that sequence. For instance, suppose the input tuple is `('when', 'I', 'drink', 'Coke', 'I', 'smile')` (note that this tuple does not need to start with `'\\x02'` or end with `'\\x03'`). To compute the probability of this tuple under our language model, we would multiply the \"trained\" probabilities for each word individually. Here that would give us \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\text{when I drink Coke I smile}) = P(\\text{when}) \\cdot P(\\text{I}) \\cdot P(\\text{drink}) \\cdot P(\\text{Coke}) \\cdot P(\\text{I}) \\cdot P(\\text{smile}) = \\left( \\frac{1}{14} \\right)^6$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if the input tuple contains a token that was not in our corpus, `probability` should return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, `sample` should take in a positive integer, `M`, and return a sentence made up of `M` randomly sampled tokens, in which the probabilities come from `mdl`. For instance, if `M=5`, then we'd return a sentence containing 5 randomly selected tokens from the table above, such that the probability that each token is selected is $\\frac{1}{14}$. The sampling is done with replacement, so we could end up with the same token multiple times. For instance, we might end up with `'but drink smile drink hurts'`. Note that this sentence doesn't make any grammatical sense (that's okay!) and that tokens are separated by spaces.\n",

    "## Part 3: Creating an N-Gram Language Model 📚\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's recap what we've done so far. Recall the chain rule for probability, where $w$ is a sentence made up of tokens $w_1, w_2, ..., w_n$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(w) = P(w_1,\\ldots,w_n) = P(w_1) \\cdot P(w_2|w_1) \\cdot P(w_3|w_1,w_2) \\cdot\\ldots\\cdot P(w_n|w_1,\\ldots,w_{n-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In Questions 3 (Uniform) and 4 (Unigram), your `train` methods computed these probabilities **unconditionally**, meaning that the probability that a token appeared in a sentence did **not depend** on the other tokens around it. That is, you said $P(w_i | w_1, w_2, ..., w_{i - 1}) = P(w_i)$. In Question 3, you let $P(w_i) = \\frac{1}{\\text{# unique tokens in corpus}}$, and in Question 4, you let $P(w_i) = \\frac{\\text{# tokens in corpus equal to $w_i$}}{\\text{# tokens in corpus}}$. Cruciually, each probability was determined by looking at the corpus that the model was trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### N-Gram Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will build an N-Gram language model, in which the probability of a token appearing in a sentence **does depend** on the tokens that come before it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The chain rule above specifies that the probability that a token occurs at in a particular position in a sentence depends on **all** previous tokens in the sentence. However, it is often the case that the likelihood that a token appears in a sentence is influenced more by **nearby** tokens. (Remember, tokens are words, punctuation, or `'\\x02'` / `'\\x03'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The N-Gram language model relies on the assumption that only nearby tokens matter. Specifically, it assumes that the probability that a token occurs depends only on the previous $N-1$ tokens, rather than all previous tokens. That is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(w_n|w_1,\\ldots,w_{n-1}) = P(w_n|w_{n-(N-1)},\\ldots,w_{n-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In an N-Gram language model, there is a hyperparameter that we get to choose when creating the model, $N$. For any $N$, the resulting N-Gram model looks at the previous $N-1$ tokens when computing probabilities. (Note that the unigram model you built in Question 4 is really an N-Gram model with $N=1$, since it looked at 0 previous tokens when computing probabilities.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Trigram Model\n",
    "\n",
    "When $N=3$, we have a \"trigram\" model. Such a model looks at the previous $N-1 = 2$ tokens when computing probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the tuple `('when', 'I', 'drink', 'Coke', 'I', 'smile')`, corresponding to the sentence `'when I drink Coke I smile'`. Under the trigram model, the probability of this sentence is computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\text{when I drink Coke I smile}) = P(\\text{when}) \\cdot P(\\text{I | when}) \\cdot P(\\text{drink | when I}) \\cdot P(\\text{Coke | I drink}) \\cdot P(\\text{I | drink Coke}) \\cdot P(\\text{smile | Coke I})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The trigram model doesn't consider the beginning of the sentence when computing the probability that the sentence ends in `'smile'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### N-Grams\n",
    "\n",
    "Both when working with a training corpus and when implementing the `probability` method to compute the probabilities of other sentences, you will need to work with \"chunks\" of $N$ tokens at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** The **N-Grams of a text** are a list of tuples containing sliding windows of length $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the trigrams in the sentence `'when I drink Coke I smile'` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "[('when', 'I', 'drink'), ('I', 'drink', 'Coke'), ('drink', 'Coke', 'I'), ('Coke', 'I', 'smile')]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Computing N-Gram Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice in our trigram model above, we computed $P(\\text{when I drink Coke I smile})$ as being the product of several conditional probabilities. These conditional probabilities are the result of **training** our N-Gram model on a training corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train an N-Gram model, we must compute a conditional probability for every $N$-token sequence in the corpus. For instance, suppose again that we are training a trigram model. Then, for every 3-token sequence $w_1, w_2, w_3$, we must compute $P(w_3 | w_1, w_2)$. To do so, we use:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(w_3 | w_1, w_2) = \\frac{C(w_1, w_2, w_3)}{C(w_1, w_2)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $C(w_1, w_2, w_3)$ is the number of occurrences of the trigram sequence $w_1, w_2, w_3$ in the training corpus and $C(w_1, w_2)$ is the number of occurrences of the bigram sequence  $w_1, w_2$ in the training corpus. (Technical note: the probabilities that we compute using the ratios of counts are _estimates_ of the true conditional probabilities of N-Grams in the population of corpuses from which our corpus was drawn.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, for any $N$, conditional probabilities are computed by dividing the counts of N-Grams by the counts of the (N-1)-Grams they follow. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In the description of Question 5.2 we provide a detailed example of how we might compute such probabilities.**\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `NGramLM` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `NGramLM` class contains a few extra methods and attributes beyond those of `UniformLM` and `UnigramLM`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instantiating `NGramLM` requires both a list of tokens and a positive integer `N`, specifying the N in N-grams. This parameter is stored in an attribute `N`.\n",
    "1. The `NGramLM` class has a method `create_ngrams` that takes in a list of tokens and returns a list of N-Grams (recall from above, an N-Gram is a **tuple** of length N). This list of N-Grams is then passed to the `train` method to train the N-Gram model.\n",
    "1. While the `train` method still creates a language model (in this case, an N-Gram model) and stores it in the `mdl` attribute, this model is most naturally stored as a DataFrame. This DataFrame will have three columns:\n",
    "    - `'ngram'`, containing the N-Grams found in the text.\n",
    "    - `'n1gram'`, containing the (N-1)-Grams upon which the N-Grams in `ngram` are built.\n",
    "    - `'prob'`, containing the probabilities of each N-Gram in `ngram`.\n",
    "1. The `NGramLM` class has an attribute `prev_mdl` that stores an (N-1)-Gram language model over the same corpus (which in turn will store an (N-2)-Gram language model over the same corpus, and so on). This is necessary to compute the probability that a word occurs at the start of a text. This code is included for you in the constructor."

    "Suppose our input tuple is `('when', 'I', 'eat', 'pizza', ',', 'I', 'smile')`, corresponding to the sentence `'when I eat pizza, I smile'` (remember again that the tuples provided to `probability` don't need to include `'\\x02'` or `'\\x03'`). Then,\n",

    "- To find $P(\\text{I | when})$, we can't just look at the `mdl` DataFrame, because `('when', 'I')` is not a trigram, it is a bigram. Instead, we look at our model's `prev_mdl` attribute, which itself is another instance of `NGramLM`, corresponding to a bigram model over the same corpus. There, we can find the probability $P(\\text{I | when})$.\n",

    "### Question 5.4 – Sampling from the N-Gram Model\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name='question5d'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The last method you implemented in the `UniformLM` and `UnigramLM` classes was `sample`, which gave you a way of generating new sentences. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you will implement the `sample` method in the `NGramLM` class. It should take in a positive integer `M` and generate a string of M tokens using the trained language model. It should begin with a starting token `'\\x02'`, then generate subsequent tokens from the probabilities in `self.mdl` and continue picking words conditional on the previous choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate how sampling works using a small concrete example. Suppose our corpus and **trigram** model are defined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    ">>> short_corpus = 'zebras eat green peas \\n\\n cows eat green grass \\n\\n zebras eat green peppers'\n",
    ">>> short_tokens = tokenize(short_corpus)\n",
    ">>> short_tokens\n",
    "['\\x02', 'zebras', 'eat', 'green', 'peas', '\\x03', '\\x02', 'cows', 'eat', 'green', 'grass', '\\x03', '\\x02', 'zebras', 'eat', 'green', 'peppers', '\\x03']\n",
    ">>> grass_model = NGramLM(3, short_tokens)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we are told to execute `grass_model.sample(5)`. Here's how we'd proceed:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. The first character in the output is `'\\x02'`, as specified above. **We won't count `'\\x02'` in the length of our output string**, so we still need to find 5 more tokens.\n",
    "1. The next character needs to be either `'zebras'` or `'cows'`, since `('\\x02', 'zebras')` and `('\\x02', 'cows')` are the only **bigrams** in `short_tokens` that start with an `'\\x02'`. $P(\\text{zebras | \\x02})$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$ and $P(\\text{cows | \\x02})$ is $\\frac{1}{3}$, so we select either `'zebras'` or `'cows'` for our next token according to these probabilities. For the sake of example, suppose we select `'cows'`. 4 more tokens to go.\n",
    "2. Now, we must look for **trigrams** that start with the bigram `('\\x02', 'cows')`. There is just one, `('\\x02', 'cows', 'eat')`, so our next token must be `'eat'`. 3 more tokens to go.\n",
    "3. Now, we must look for **trigrams** that start with the bigram `('cows', 'eat')`. Again, there is just one, `('cows', 'eat', 'green')`, so our next token must be `'green'`. 2 more tokens to go.\n",
    "4. Now, we must look for **trigrams** that start with the bigram `('eat', 'green')`. There are three options – `('eat', 'green', 'peas')`, `('eat', 'green', 'grass')`, and `('eat', 'green', 'peppers')`. Since $P(\\text{peas | eat green}) = P(\\text{grass | eat green}) = P(\\text{peppers | eat green}) = \\frac{1}{3}$, we pick either `'peas'`, `'grass'`, or `'peppers'` uniformly at random. For the sake of example, suppose we select `'peppers'`. 1 more token to go.\n",
    "5. We must end the output string now with `'\\x03'`, putting us at `'\\x02'` plus 5 tokens, which is the number of tokens we were told to sample. Note that `'\\x03'` **does** count towards the number of tokens we were asked to sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our result is `'\\x02 cows eat green peppers \\x03'`. **Note that in our training corpus we never encountered an instance of cows 🐄 eating green peppers 🫑, but we were able to generate a coherent sentence in which they did – pretty cool!**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional guidance:\n",
    "- If you run into a situation where there are no N-Grams that match the most recent (N-1)-Gram, you should add `'\\x03'` (STOP) token as the next token in your output sentence. There is a chance that your sampled sentence ends in many `'\\x03'`s, and that's fine.\n",
    "- Helper functions and recursion will be very helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've understood the above example, complete the implementation of the `sample` method in `NGramLM`."
