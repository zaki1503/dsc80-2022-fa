    "In [Lecture 9](https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc80-2022-fa/tree/main/lectures/09-data_imputation/notebook/lab.ipynb), you learned how to impute a quantitative column by sampling from the observed values. **One problem with this technique is that the imputation will never generate imputed values that weren't already in the dataset.** For example, 57, 57.5, and 59 are values in the `'child'` column of `new_heights` while 58 is not. Thus, any imputation done by sampling from the observed values in the `'child'` column will not be able to generate a height of 58, even though it's clearly a reasonable value to occur in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things simple, you will impute the `'child'` column **unconditionally** from the distribution of `'child'` heights present in the dataset. This means that you will use the values present in `'child'` to impute missing values, without looking at other columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "An approach to quantitative imputation that overcomes the limitation mentioned above is as follows:\n",
    "- Create a histogram of observed `'child'` heights, using 10 bins.\n",
    "- Use the histogram to generate a number within the observed range of `'child'` heights:\n",
    "    - The likelihood a generated number belongs to a given bin is equal to the area of that bin. (Remember, in histograms, areas are proportions.)\n",
    "    - Any number within a fixed bin is equally likely to occur.\n",

    "Let's illustrate this approach with an example. Let `demo` be the array of 10 numbers defined below.\n",

    "- Next, we need to pick a bin at random. There's a 30\\% chance we pick the [10, 12) bin, a 20\\% chance we pick the [12, 14) bin, and a 50\\% chance we pick the [14, 16] bin. `np.random.choice` will be helpful in picking a bin at random.\n",
    "- Once we pick a bin, we pick a number **uniformly at random** from within the bin. For instance, suppose we randomly chose the [14, 16] bin in the previous step. We then must select a (real) number between 14 and 16 uniformly at random. `np.random.uniform` can help you here.\n",

    "\n",
    "When browsing through `robots.txt` files, you may notice that some have entries for several different user-agents. The user-agent you are interested in for this question is the generic user-agent, which is denoted by `*`. A `/` after a `Disallow:` indicates that no scraping is allowed, whereas nothing after the `Disallow:` or a `/` after `Allow:` indicates that all scraping is allowed.\n",

    "- During your search, you may notice that very few websites allow scraping by everyone. When trying to find websites that satisfy this criteria, you are encouraged to think contextually about what kinds of websites would and wouldn't mind you scraping their data. Would a government website likely mind scraping by everyone? How about a website someone created just for fun?\n",
