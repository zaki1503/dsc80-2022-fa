    "\n",
    "Professor Billy often sends out extra credit surveys asking students for their favorite animals, movies, and other favorite things. These surveys are stored in the `data/extra-credit-surveys` folder. Each file in that folder corresponds to a different survey question (except for `favorite1.csv`, which contains students' names and IDs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how extra credit works:\n",
    "- Each student who has completed at least 50% of the survey questions receives 5 points of extra credit.\n",
    "- If there is at least one survey question that at least 80% of the class answered (e.g. favorite animal), **everyone** in the class receives 1 point of extra credit. This overall class extra credit only applies twice, so if for example 95% of students answer the favorite color survey question and 91% answer the favorite animal survey question, and and 97% answer the favorite movie question, the entire class still receives 2 extra point as a class, not 3.\n",
    "- Note that this means that the most extra credit any student can earn is 7 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `read_student_surveys`\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a function `read_student_surveys` which takes in a string describing the path to a folder containing `favorite*.csv` files and outputs a DataFrame containing all of the survey data combined, indexed by student ID (a value 1-1000).\n",

    "Create a function `check_credit` which takes in a DataFrame returned by `read_student_surveys` and outputs a DataFrame indexed by student ID (a value 1-1000) with two columns:\n",
    "- `'name'`, containing the name of each student, and\n",
