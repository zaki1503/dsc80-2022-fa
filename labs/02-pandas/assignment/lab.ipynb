    "**Note**: Labs will have public tests and private tests. The public \"smoke tests\" that you will run below and which appear on Gradescope are generally worth no points. After the due date, we will replace these tests with private tests that will determine your grade. This is different from DSC 10, where labs only had public tests!\n",

Last Saturday, this store sold 250 wet suits to UCSD students. After a surf session, 10 students complained that their wet suits had tears in them, letting the cold ocean water to rush in the suit.
